[2025-10-12 15:21:36 UTC] 
I want to plan with you how to integrate data provenance into the ingestion and insertion code. Maybe a separate data source table that includes the original filename and the datetime of ingestion. Then, all associated tables can reference back to that data source - unless there is a CCDA standard, which we'd want to consider. Thoughts?
[2025-10-12 15:21:37 UTC]  Log this session's prompts at docs/AI_prompts.py by appending to the current document.
[2025-10-12 15:30:29 UTC] Another thing we would want to record, if present, is the original zip file name. That is likely not going to be unique (as the original_filename is not unique), but it would be good to have in case it contains contextual information.
[2025-10-12 15:32:45 UTC] Do not continue to log prompts to AI_prompts.py, only AI_prompts.md. Additionally, do not log IDE contextual information, follow the AGENTS.md standard of a timestamp and the literal prompt.
Next, thread source_archive into the ingestion pipeline.
[2025-10-12 15:37:40 UTC] Before we continue - hold that thought - I have a git repo branch I want this work to live on: 6-add-data-provenance-and-attachments but I forgot to check it out. Move all of these changes onto the new branch.
[2025-10-12 15:38:35 UTC] OK. Let's work through the threading of the data_source_id for the remaining tables.
[2025-10-12 15:50:02 UTC] I think I inadvertantly interrupted you, please continue.
[2025-10-12 16:10:10 UTC] I think you ran into a venv issue.
[2025-10-12 16:13:39 UTC] I will look into the venv issue. Do any of the ingest scripts need to be updated to account for the datasource ID?
[2025-10-12 16:14:21 UTC] Sorry, I meant, do any of the parsing scripts need to be updated?
[2025-10-12 17:00:24 UTC] Remove the data_provenance table from the schema - that functionality is now with the data_source table. Also remove the source_file field from patient.
[2025-10-12 18:11:24 UTC] I want you to examine the METADATA.xml files in the data/ folder. I think these can be useful for the data_sources table. Next, ensure that if a document does not have an associated person, it is not ingested. METADATA.XML is causing a blank person to be added to the patients table.
[2025-10-12 18:41:30 UTC] I have an attachment table where I can link to data_source files so that they can be read in the raw in streamlit. Create the code that populates the attachment information as the files are being ingested.
[2025-10-12 18:55:11 UTC] The ingestion worked well! Get rid of the encounter ID in the attachment table. In the data_source table, add a FK to the attachment table.
[2025-10-12 19:14:00 UTC] I want to work on the streamlit frontend now. When the app loads, I want there to be a listing of encounter dates and types that the user clicks on that will take them to a detail page for that encounter and everything related to that encounter. Before working on it, make sure I answer any uncertainties or vagueness.
[2025-10-12 19:16:40 UTC] Encounters should be by patient, so I guess the path starts where the user chooses a patient to use across the app. In the detailed encounter view, I want everything - conditions, medications, labs, progress notes, metadata, vitals. I want the detailed information to open on a separate page that can be closed to see the visits overview page.

I understand this may require adding additional python packages to support multipage and navigation functions.
[2025-10-12 19:23:06 UTC] 1. My preference is the implementation that would be most intuitive.
2. We'd want all immunizations up to the date of the encounter and encounter procedures. For metadata, we'd want to provide information on the encounter date (time if available), provider, data source, attachment
3. A button is fine.
[2025-10-12 19:32:37 UTC] It _mostly_ works. I am getting this error when interacting with it:
AttributeError: module 'streamlit' has no attribute 'experimental_rerun'

File "Z:\\Health\\Health-Records-Collection\\frontend\\app.py", line 25, in <module>

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[2025-10-12 19:42:41 UTC] We're getting some lab result duplication. Let's ensure uniqueness by patient number, encounter number, and loinc code.
[2025-10-12 19:45:07 UTC] The actual provider for this encounter is [redacted]. Can you make sense of that?
[2025-10-12 19:47:15 UTC] [redacted XML snippet] I pasted what I see.
[2025-10-12 20:00:07 UTC] You can continue logging per usual. Could you add to the AGENTS.md instructions on how to direct you to log something, but with sections that need to be redacted?
[2025-10-12 20:10:00 UTC] In the file open in the IDE, DOC0006.XML, the provider is [redacted]. Why was this not picked up in the ingestion and parsing processes?
[2025-10-12 20:17:13 UTC] I re-ingested and that provider was not picked up for that data source.
[2025-10-12 20:23:45 UTC] Re-ingested and it is the same issue. It may be worthwhile to consider having a separate organization table and provider table where we can link providers to organizations and the encounters to providers, not their orgs.

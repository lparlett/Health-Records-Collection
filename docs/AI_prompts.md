[2025-10-12 00:47:06 UTC]
Review db folder files for AGENTS.md compliance.
[2025-10-12 15:21:36 UTC]
I want to plan with you how to integrate data provenance into the ingestion and insertion code. Maybe a separate data source table that includes the original filename and the datetime of ingestion. Then, all associated tables can reference back to that data source - unless there is a CCDA standard, which we'd want to consider. Thoughts?
[2025-10-12 15:21:37 UTC]
Log this session's prompts at docs/AI_prompts.py by appending to the current document.
[2025-10-12 15:30:29 UTC]
Another thing we would want to record, if present, is the original zip file name. That is likely not going to be unique (as the original_filename is not unique), but it would be good to have in case it contains contextual information.
[2025-10-12 15:32:45 UTC]
Do not continue to log prompts to AI_prompts.py, only AI_prompts.md. Additionally, do not log IDE contextual information, follow the AGENTS.md standard of a timestamp and the literal prompt.
Next, thread source_archive into the ingestion pipeline.
[2025-10-12 15:37:40 UTC]
Before we continue - hold that thought - I have a git repo branch I want this work to live on: 6-add-data-provenance-and-attachments but I forgot to check it out. Move all of these changes onto the new branch.
[2025-10-12 15:38:35 UTC]
OK. Let's work through the threading of the data_source_id for the remaining tables.
[2025-10-12 15:50:02 UTC]
I think I inadvertantly interrupted you, please continue.
[2025-10-12 16:10:10 UTC]
I think you ran into a venv issue.
[2025-10-12 16:13:39 UTC]
I will look into the venv issue. Do any of the ingest scripts need to be updated to account for the datasource ID?
[2025-10-12 16:14:21 UTC]
Sorry, I meant, do any of the parsing scripts need to be updated?
[2025-10-12 17:00:24 UTC]
Remove the data_provenance table from the schema - that functionality is now with the data_source table. Also remove the source_file field from patient.
[2025-10-12 18:11:24 UTC]
I want you to examine the METADATA.xml files in the data/ folder. I think these can be useful for the data_sources table. Next, ensure that if a document does not have an associated person, it is not ingested. METADATA.XML is causing a blank person to be added to the patients table.
[2025-10-12 18:41:30 UTC]
I have an attachment table where I can link to data_source files so that they can be read in the raw in streamlit. Create the code that populates the attachment information as the files are being ingested.
[2025-10-12 18:55:11 UTC]
The ingestion worked well! Get rid of the encounter ID in the attachment table. In the data_source table, add a FK to the attachment table.
[2025-10-12 19:14:00 UTC]
I want to work on the streamlit frontend now. When the app loads, I want there to be a listing of encounter dates and types that the user clicks on that will take them to a detail page for that encounter and everything related to that encounter. Before working on it, make sure I answer any uncertainties or vagueness.
[2025-10-12 19:16:40 UTC]
Encounters should be by patient, so I guess the path starts where the user chooses a patient to use across the app. In the detailed encounter view, I want everything - conditions, medications, labs, progress notes, metadata, vitals. I want the detailed information to open on a separate page that can be closed to see the visits overview page.

I understand this may require adding additional python packages to support multipage and navigation functions.
[2025-10-12 19:23:06 UTC]

1. My preference is the implementation that would be most intuitive.
2. We'd want all immunizations up to the date of the encounter and encounter procedures. For metadata, we'd want to provide information on the encounter date (time if available), provider, data source, attachment
3. A button is fine.

[2025-10-12 19:32:37 UTC]
It _mostly_ works. I am getting this error when interacting with it:
[troubleshooting redacted]

[2025-10-12 19:42:41 UTC]
We're getting some lab result duplication. Let's ensure uniqueness by patient number, encounter number, and loinc code.
[2025-10-12 19:45:07 UTC]
The actual provider for this encounter is [redacted]. Can you make sense of that?
[2025-10-12 19:47:15 UTC]
[redacted XML snippet] I pasted what I see.
[2025-10-12 20:00:07 UTC]
You can continue logging per usual. Could you add to the AGENTS.md instructions on how to direct you to log something, but with sections that need to be redacted?
[2025-10-12 20:10:00 UTC]
In the file open in the IDE, DOC0006.XML, the provider is [redacted]. Why was this not picked up in the ingestion and parsing processes?
[2025-10-12 20:17:13 UTC]
I re-ingested and that provider was not picked up for that data source.
[2025-10-12 20:23:45 UTC]
Re-ingested and it is the same issue. It may be worthwhile to consider having a separate organization table and provider table where we can link providers to organizations and the encounters to providers, not their orgs.
[2025-10-12 20:49:56 UTC]
My encounter notes look like [redacted]. I don't like how some words run together. The bar separator from the joins is working, but not for each part. Can you fix that?

[2025-10-12 21:06:55 UTC]
Store in docs/AI_prompts.md. Use Attempt 1 / Version 1 suggestions.
[2025-10-12 21:40:31 UTC]
One change - I don't want these trends embedded within encounter details - I want a separate selectable page separate from encounters where all trends can be viewed.
[2025-10-12 22:06:00 UTC]
Where in the lab service script does it specify that uniqueness has to exist for date, encounter id, and loinc composite?
[2025-10-12 22:07:29 UTC]
I want labs to only be inserted if they don't violate unique by date, encounter id, and loinc code.
[2025-10-12 22:28:02 UTC]
Final update for the frontend views.... if there is a lab trend, I want the ability to turn on / turn off the reference range visual indicators on the graph. Vitals won't have that option since there aren't really reference ranges for them.
[2025-10-12 22:48:14 UTC]
What are the current encounter uniqueness constraints?
[2025-10-12 22:50:45 UTC]
If provider_id is null, I do not want that to be treated as distinct - that is, if it is missing and otherwise matches another row, I do not want it inserted.
[2025-10-12 23:04:38 UTC]
Fix the iterable problems in ingest.py lines 270, 295, and 310
[2025-10-12 23:08:06 UTC]
Encounters is still dodgy. Let's put it this way - I don't want to insert an encounter unless it has a date, source encounter ID, and provider ID. And when it has those values, they are the unique constraint.
[2025-10-12 23:08:26 UTC]

Fix this error, here's the traceback:
[redacted]
NameError: name '_xpath_elements' is not defined
[2025-10-12 23:24:54 UTC]
How are encounter dates being parsed?

[2025-10-12 23:40:33 UTC]
I only want to pull the effective time from the encompassing encounter fallback to service event and fallback to something else reasonable.

[2025-10-12 23:48:14 UTC]
We're still getting unnecessary duplication of encounters. Let's make the uniqueness constraint just the patient id, provider id, and date.

[2025-10-12 23:48:38 UTC]
My DOB was ingested for a lot of dates. Tighten the XPath to ensure that effective time isn't being pulled from somewhere inappropriate.

[2025-10-12 23:54:16 UTC]
I cannot confirm that. I am still seeing encounter dates matching my DOB.

[2025-10-12 23:55:11 UTC]
No! I want to prefer individuals!

[2025-10-12 23:59:43 UTC]
I didn't see much change at all. There are still a ton attached to an organization when I know the individual provider is named in the document.

[2025-10-13 00:00:00 UTC]
Ensure my prompts are logged. Fix pylance problems in the xml_utils.py and update-sytlesheets.yml files.

Fix this error: [troubleshooting redacted]

[2025-10-13 00:00:00 UTC]
Reminder to log every prompt. How can I ensure that you will do this without my reminders?

[2025-10-13 00:00:00 UTC]
Check that all prompts from this session have been logged and appended, in order, to the prompt log.

[2025-10-13 00:01:23 UTC]
Don't forget to log all prompts. Review our convo and add additional prompts to the md/AI_prompts.md file as appropriate.

[2025-10-13 00:15:45 UTC]
Next thing to fix is in the frontend - I don't want a patient trend sub-part of the encounter detail page.

[2025-10-13 00:25:12 UTC]
lines 597 and 602

[2025-10-13 00:30:00 UTC]
bring my prompt log up to date

[2025-10-13 00:45:12 UTC]
Proactively log my prompts. The next thing I want to fix in the views is with respect to the attachment. Currently the file name is displaying properly; however, there is no link to anything. I want it to link to the actual file it references.

[2025-10-13 01:15:23 UTC]
I tested this out and the HTML link is only file///.... the attachment path is missing.

[2025-10-13 01:25:45 UTC]
There are no HTML files in the HTML - only unrelated style. The XSLT can be based on this repo: HL7/CDA-core-xsl

[2025-10-13 01:35:12 UTC]
Let's add 3.

[2025-10-13 01:45:00 UTC]
Log any unlogged prompts. Add dark mode support.

[2025-10-13 02:00:12 UTC]
I click on the XML attachment [redacted] But nothing happens. It doesn't even try to open anything.

[2025-10-13 02:15:00 UTC]
Reminder to proactively log my prompts. Review and add any that are missing.

[2025-10-13 02:30:00 UTC]
We've reverted behavior. When I click "open file", it opens the XML in Edge and shows a white window rather than opening in the Firefox window.

[2025-10-13 23:33:16 UTC]
I've worked with Claude to implement some frontend upgrades. I need to get the attachment XML viewer to work. Right now, I press the button and nothing happens. Review AGENTS.md for my guidelines and log every prompt in doc/AI_prompts.md

[2025-10-13 23:43:19 UTC]
I see a lot of being unable to build an XML preview in the re-launched app.
[2025-10-13 23:58:59 UTC]
Re-read the AGENTS.md file as I have modified it. The XML preview looks wonderful. Don't touch that. The Open File button is not pointing to the correct place - it starts in the project directory, which is fine; however, that is not my system's root directory, so it points to nothing.
[2025-10-14 00:29:55 UTC]
That didn't fix it. The link is still starting in the project directory rather than the absolute path.

[2025-10-14 00:31:32 UTC]
Store this sessions prompts in docs/AI_prompts.md. Re-read the AGENTS.md, which directs you to NOT include IDE context information.

[2025-10-14 00:32:14 UTC]
OK - continue your fix of the open attachment button.

[2025-10-14 00:35:27 UTC]
It still starts at the project directory and not the server share (we also need to test when on a local drive, but that's for later).

[2025-10-14 00:45:52 UTC]
The open file in my IDE with changes accepted worked to open the attachment. How does that differ from the current file and can you bring the current file into alignment?

[2025-10-14 00:56:25 UTC]
You know what? Now that we have the inline XML preview, we don't need the open attachment button anymore. Let's get rid of that. Also, tell me which document is styling the inline XML file.

[2025-10-14 01:05:12 UTC]
The custom overrides will not work because style in a document takes precedence over any referenced stylesheet, right?

[2025-10-14 01:07:33 UTC]
Where does the main streamlit app get its style information?

[2025-10-18 22:29:11 UTC]
Fix this error.

[2025-10-18 22:34:29 UTC]
Reread the AGENTS.md file and revise the prompt logging thus far to comply with all instructions.

[2025-10-18 22:39:30 UTC]
You keep adding in IDE context and active file and environment information that I DO NOT want in the prompt log. I've made it fairly clear in the AGENTS.md file - what else do I have to do to get you to STOP DOING THAT.
[2025-10-18 22:42:29 UTC]
You say that now, but it's been an issue. How do I get you to maintain this behavior session to session? I thought that AGENTS.md was supposed to do that.

[2025-10-18 22:43:45 UTC]
Before moving on, tell me if there are any parts of AGENTS.md that are ambiguous to you so that I can clarify.

[2025-10-18 22:44:33 UTC]
You keep logging the AGENTS.md file as part of user instructions in every session. I have had to delete that out. WIll you refrain from logging that in the future?

[2025-10-18 22:48:09 UTC]
To prepare for our first tagged release, I want to do some cleanning up of logging. I think one way of doing this is to add a run parameter than request detailed deugging logging info - otherwise, the logging to the console or saved to a file can be minimal. Just enough for the user to know data are being ingested into the SQL database. We also want to be sensitive to personal information being logged to console or file.

[2025-10-18 23:11:52 UTC]
What are some other things that I should be thinking about to prepare this tagged release?

[2025-10-18 23:20:21 UTC]
OK. Let's start at the top of your list. Let's confirm that there are tests that cover all ingestion, parsing, and upserting code. I just ran the current suite and we passed every test.

[2025-10-18 23:25:37 UTC]
Add the CLI logging test code

[2025-10-18 23:28:49 UTC]
Refresh the README file to include the logging argument and any other updates not properly noted.

[2025-10-18 23:31:10 UTC]
Let's freeze the packages used for this project in a requirements document
[2025-10-19 00:02:09 UTC]
Let's discuss what the release tag should be for this work so far.

[2025-10-19T22:03Z]

I've just released my first pre-release tag for my github repo. [https://github.com/lparlett/Health-Records-Collection](https://github.com/lparlett/Health-Records-Collection) I added it into Zenodo. Aside from continuing development, what do people generally do after their casual coding projects have a release?

[2025-10-19T22:08Z]

If I have ideas about where I want the development to go, how should I document that in the repo?

[2025-10-19T22:15Z]

I want to talk about a major update idea.... is it possible to use the streamlit front end to identify zip files to ingest and parse and then display? That is, I don't want to have to run ingest.py and then the front end. I want to run the frontend only, if possible. In that front end, I want an area where I can identify zip files to ingest.

[2025-10-19T22:21Z]

No. Let me figure out how I want to develop it - you remember and then provide a suggested roadmap that would work as a casual project. I want to start ingesting through streamlit. I also want to revamp the streamlit look. Right now it's pretty bare bones, but I definitely want to invest some time into the UX. Perhaps some calendar/date visuals or filtering. Also some provider/visit type filtering. I want to add an allergies table and insurance table. I don't want to expand the kind of data that are being ingested/parsed. No need for right now. Give me twenty other ideas on how to further develop this project.

[2025-10-19T22:30Z]

Oh! Another thing I want to add is the ability to edit and an audit trail of any edits so that values can be reverted to what came from the original data.

---

[2025-10-19T22:38Z]

In terms of your additional development ideas, I like:
Tagging system — allow manual tags for visits (“urgent care,” “follow-up,” “immunization”).
 Record provenance viewer — show file name, import date, and hash for each record.
 Compact analytics dashboard — mini KPIs like total meds, avg. encounters per year.
 Search bar — global search across diagnoses, labs, and medications.
 Toggle between dark and light mode using Streamlit theme config.
 Highlight abnormal labs using color-coded ranges.
 Configurable data directory — selectable local folder for SQLite DB and imported files.
 Schema browser — automatically generate a visual ER diagram in-app from the DB.
 Data export panel — let users download filtered data as CSV.
 Notes viewer — parse and display narrative clinical notes separately from structured fields.
 Basic auth or local PIN — lightweight password for sensitive sessions.
 Help overlay — small inline tooltips explaining each section of the UI.
 Error sandbox — log ingestion errors and let the user download them for inspection.
 Theming presets — toggle between “clinical,” “minimalist,” and “research notebook” styles.
 Data quality checks — add a tab summarizing missing values, inconsistent codes, or duplicate entries.

In addition, I want to be a good resource user and do file housekeeping as needed.

Turn all of this into a proposed roadmap.

[2025-10-19T22:46]

Move the additional tables to the next version (that'll be easy to implement). Move the editing and provenance earlier in the roadmap.
[2025-10-19 23:15:17 UTC] This session's prompts are saved in docs/AI_prompts.md. We're going to start work on v0.2.0. Review the ROADMAP and AGENTS.md files. Then, before doing any work, return to me to talk through your plan.
[2025-10-19 23:17:51 UTC] Wedo not currently capture allergies or insurance info. These will have to be separate parsers and upsert services. The notes are already captured in the progress_notes table. Now we have to figure out a good way of displaying them.\n\nThe ER diagram should live in Streamlit and our documentation.
[2025-10-19 23:18:47 UTC] That is all correct. You can commence.
[2025-10-19 23:30:59 UTC] Failed run. Retry.
[2025-10-19 23:59:58 UTC] We need to update the insurance ingestion to capture the right parts. Here is the relevant XML, you'll want to extract the info from here:\n\n[redacted]\n
[2025-10-20 00:22:54 UTC] The GitHub action workflow had Status Startup failure \n\nError\nThe action peter-evans/create-pull-request@v6 is not allowed in lparlett/Health-Records-Collection because all actions must be from a repository owned by lparlett or created by GitHub.
[2025-10-20 00:24:50 UTC] Walk me through how to do option 1. I've never forked a repo before
[2025-10-20 00:59:58 UTC] For the GitHub action, I don't want to have to approve pull requests every day. Is there a way to only request a PR if the files differ or have been updated?
[2025-10-20 01:01:12 UTC] BTW - I ended up opting to change the repo setting rather than forking.
